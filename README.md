# Brent's dotfiles

Rake install and you've got my VIM and bash setup. I keep general shortcuts and settings in my 
.zshrc, and specific computer/personal shortcuts outside the repo in my ~/.bash_profile

## Other necessities

**Homebrew** http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/

**Macvim** brew install (gives me the mvim command)

```terminal
$ brew install macvim --override-system-vim
```

**Hub** https://github.com/defunkt/hub
```terminal
$ brew install hub
```
