# Brent's dotfiles

Rake install and you've got my setup. I keep general shortcuts and settings in my 
.zshrc, and specific personal shortcuts in my .bash_profile

## Other necessities
**Macvim** install using

```terminal
$ brew install macvim --override-system-vim
```

**Hub** https://github.com/defunkt/hub
```terminal
$ brew install hub
```
